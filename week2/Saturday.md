Designing Solutions in the Cloud - Always think about the 6 Pillars

1. Operational Excellence
   - Perform operations as code
   - Make frequent, small, reversible changes
   - Refine operations procedures frequently
   - Anticipate failure
   - Learn from all operational failures

2. Security - Its all about protecting data, systems, and assets running in the cloud
   - In flight and At Rest protection through encryption
   - Automate secuity best practices
   - Prepare for security breaches
3. Reliability - The ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently when itâ€™s expected to
   - Availability
   - Disaster Recovery
   - Scalability
4. Performance Efficiency - The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements.
   - Go global in a matter of minutes
   - Go serverless as much as you can to eliminate operational burden
5. Cost Optimization - The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

6. Sustainability - This pillar focuses on environmental impacts, especially energy consumption and efficiency. continuous effort focused primarily on energy reduction and efficiency across all components of a workload by achieving the maximum benefit from the resources provisioned and minimizing the total resources required
